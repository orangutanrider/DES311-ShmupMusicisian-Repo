This folder is for prefabs that you place yourself while in the Unity editor. If you were making a level, you'd place certain things in it by using this folder.

This folder is not for prefabs that get instantiated, though exceptions may apply. Simply put, there shouldn't be prefabs for things like bullets in here.
